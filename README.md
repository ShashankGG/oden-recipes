# odin-recipes
Taking up this project to get hands-on knowledge of HTML and CSS. Although this is a basic and beginner level project, I will be viewing this as a stepping stone in my journey of expanding and honing my skills in Web Development, as well as getting used to working long hours and crafting something of my own with dedication and discipline.

I will be using VSCode as my code editor and Xubuntu as my operating system. My primary learning resource is 'The Odin Project'.
