    <p>White Sauce Pasta (also referred to as White Pasta) is one of the most popular and easiest pasta recipes that you can make at home. In this White Sauce Pasta Recipe, I am sharing an easy way to make a restaurant style white sauce (or b√©chamel sauce) in which cooked penne pasta is tossed. The recipe comes together in 30 minutes and makes for a comforting brunch or lunch.</p>
