    <p>A slice of classic cheese pizza is one of life's greatest pleasures. While calling for delivery is always a treat, being able to make your own pizza recipes at home is even more satisfying. This recipe covers the basics: kneading a simple dough, stretching it into a round, and cranking up your oven to get that perfect char. The tasty reward is a crispy-bottomed, airy crust topped with tangy tomato sauce, and milky mozzarella.</p>
